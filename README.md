# python-challenge

In this challenge, we take a look at two separate sets of data and use Visual Studio Code to extract relevant information and create a summary of the data. 

The first set of data we have is a csv file that gives financial data for a company. The information provided is the date (month/year) and the corresponding profit/loss for that date. Using VS Code we are able to calculate:
1.The total number of months in the data set
2.The total profit/loss for the time period provided
3.The average change from month to month
4.The months that had the greatest increase/decrease in profits and the profit/loss amount that corresponds.

The second set of data is another csv file. This one provides election information organized by the voter's ballot ID, the voter's county, and the voter's chosen candidate. In order to make this information more useful, we broke the data down into:
1.The total number of votes cast in the election
2.The name of each candidate in the election, with each's corresponding percentage of the total votes and number of votes received

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

Who won the election!
